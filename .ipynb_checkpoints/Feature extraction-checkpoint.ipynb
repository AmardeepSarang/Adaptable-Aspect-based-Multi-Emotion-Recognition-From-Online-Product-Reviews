The assembly is easy if you can hadle simple tools at all. They can navigate them well even on lawn and around the dirt areas of our yard. The best part is that they are kid powered and can only go as fast as they can peddle(on the flat). They get their exercise and can learn the skills of turning both forward and backward.

       " \"The Kabrio will arrive at your home mostly assembled. You only need to assemble the seat assembly and steering wheel assembly. Very easy and they include a wrench that will be needed. Car is very sturdy but was a bit smaller than I though it would be. My 7 year old son fits on it easily though (he's small for his age) Seat has adjustability range of about 8 inches and adjusts easily without removing bolts or pins. Car pedals easily and has a shifter so you can shift out of gear and the car free wheels. This is good for coming down hills. Be warned that if the speed gets to high that the steering of the car is very fast and abrupt and it is possible to tip it over. Wheels are hard plastic with a softer vinyl tread over them. Traction has not been a problem for us. We purchased this item when it was greatly reduced and because of this we feel it was a great value. I don't know how happy I would be if I had paid full price though. In summary we think it is a great ride-on and well built that the kids think is cool!!\",\n",
